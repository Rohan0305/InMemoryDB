# InMemoryDB
-----------------------------------
SETUP:

Go to onlinegdb.com
Set language to C++ 17
Copy main.cpp from github repo and paste it into the main.cpp file on onlinegdb
Create a new file called InMemoryDB.h and copy and paste the InMemoryDB.h code from the github repo
Create a new file called InMemoryDB.cpp and copy and paste the InMemoryDB.cpp code from the github repo
**IMPORTANT - Make sure the the main.cpp file is selected ** and then click run

IMPROVEMENTS: 

I would say add more edge case examples because I had to wonder about all the scenarios that the code would not work as expected. Also, I would suggest that the instructions were more clear on the UI to help a user perform the actions being tested. Due to the little information on the UI, I just made a simple while loop where users can input their choices. Also, I would suggest to make this assignment done in one language for everyone and then right a script to test test cases so students can see what they missed.
